# Hatched!
## The Game

Play the game on [twitch.io](https://moddisms.itch.io/hatchedegg)

MMM presents Hatched!: A game where you help eggs become new life! Create different animals by curating the hatching process. The transition is affected by both the egg chosen and the level of warmth given to incubate the egg, each combination giving different results!

Try to discover all nine critters (and one fritter)!
